=File Backup and Management System=
==Project Description==
Version control systems are powerful tools, but often outside of the grasp and interest of casual users. The File Backup and Management System, or FBMS, is a hybrid backup and versioning control system that's low maintenance, easy to use, and ensures the user's files are safe and sound. Akin to programs like Dropbox and Google Drive, FBMS runs in the background, automatically backing up the user's files. Unlike those web services, FBMS runs entirely locally, making it useful where internet access is sporadic or bandwidth is limited. FBMS also does not require subscriptions to a web service, being instead limited by your own hard drive space.

Unlike Google Drive and Dropbox, FBMS allows users to keep old file revisions for as long as you want. Revisions are as compact as can be, being stored as incremental diff files. Users can, at their discretion, specify limits to how long or how many older revisions they want to keep.

==Work Unit Decomposition==
We decomposed the student advising system into the following components.
