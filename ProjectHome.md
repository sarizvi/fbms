# FBMS #
### The File Backup and Management System ###

FBMS is a program for keeping your important files backed up automatically with version control. FBMS works as a hybrid between the power and difficulty of version control systems like SVN and the simple but limited web-based backup solutions like Dropbox.

FBMS runs in the background, keeping track of changes to files, providing both a backup and a versioning system.
